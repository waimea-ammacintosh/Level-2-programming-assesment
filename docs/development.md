when you try move a coin one space, the program automatically doesn't like it and says you cant move it there as there
are no available spaces. So to fix this i changed one of my lines from if (!grid.sliced(coinDestination, movingCoinIndex).contains(EMPTY)) {
to if (!grid.subList(coinDestination, movingCoinIndex).contains(EMPTY)) { which fixed the problem.
