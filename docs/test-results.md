## Coin input

Test to check if the user can input a valid amount of coins to play with, within the set boundaries (5-15). Test if other invalid data is not allowed by program.

### Test Data Used: 4,5,15,16,(blank), thh

Using these values will allow me to check if my boundaries (5 and 15) still work, and it will allow me to see if how the program will handle a number out of range, and how it will handle blanks/non-integers

### Test Result

[Coin input test](captures/CoinNum.gif)

The program worked as expected. When I entered the in bound numbers, it allowed it to pass, and it did not allow out of bound or non-integer inputs.
